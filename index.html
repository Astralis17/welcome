                        <p>I know you already had the little letter thing I wrote which you've read since you're here <smol>(if you haven't then I'm very confused)</smol>, but I wanted to write a bit here because I like writing little letters and things especially to you my dear <3</3></p>
                        <p>But yeah, so welcome back, you're back what a week now, hopefully all the jetlag and such has worn off by now. And hopefully you're not missing me too much, though based off myself I think you will, because I'm missing you so goddam much as I write this.</p>
